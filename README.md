# Surf's Up
## Overview
The purpose of this module was to give us practice with advanced data storage and retrieval. To achieve this, we were given the following scenario: while on vacation in Hawaii, I discovered a passion for surfing and want to move there. I also want to open a Surfshop that sells surfing items and ice cream, and I'm going to need investor backing to get the idea off the ground. I reach out to an investor called W.Avy who is going to take my idea to the board after I've performed analyses on weather data of the island (Oahu) where I want to open the surf shop. During these analyses, I learned the following items:
- explaining the structures, interactions and data types of a data set
- learning the difference between SQLite and PosrgreSQL databases
- using SQLAlchemy to connect to a SQLite database
- using SQLAlchemy to query a SQLite database
- use statistics to analyze data
- create flask applications using data
## Results

According to the results, there were three key differences in the weather between June and December. They were as follows:
- Minimum temperature
  - the minimum temperature in June was 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature in December was 56 degreees.
- Mean temperature
  - the mean temperature in June was 74.9 degrees, while the mean temperature in December was 71.0 degrees.
- Number of temperatures recorded
  - there were 1700 temperatures recorded in June, while there were only 1517 temperatures recorded in December.
## Summary
Based on temperature alone, I would inform W.Avy that it looks like the shop could be open year-round. In a seven year period, the minimum temperature of one of the coolest months of the year was 56 degrees. Thus, based on the temperatures I would say that the shop is sustainable year-round. However, I would inform him that I would like to generate the summary statistics on precipitation data in June and December as well. After all, Oahu is a tropical island and prone to getting a great deal of rain. I want to ensure that the surf shop isn't going to flood. Additionally, I would like to compare the same data (e.g., the temperature on June 8, 2014) between the all the stations to ensure accuracy of the data. This venture will not be inexpensive, and I want to be able to show the investors myself that I did my homework; I want to be able to show them that this is what I did to ensure the data was accurate and thus they can be confident in their investment of my shop.
